Tibia is a MMORPG developed by Cipsoft GmbH. OTServ is the open-source implementation of the game server.

This wireshark dissector decodes the game's communication protocol. It supports all versions from Tibia 7.1 up to Tibia 11.22 (2003-2015). 

Newer versions of the protocol use RSA/XTEA in order to provide a secure communication channel. 
In order to dissect packets on these versions, the symmetric (XTEA) key need be provided manually via the preferences Dialog.
In case the private key is provided, Login packets will be decoded to acquire the XTEA key.
OTServ's private key is included by default, so decoding most OTServ traffic should work out of the box.
